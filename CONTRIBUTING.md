## Style Guide

We follow a modified version of the
[GitHub Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
with a few exceptions inspired by Seattle.rb style:

* Only include parentheses to clarify logical intent or for parsing order
* Use of `do...end` is preferred if the in-line block would overflow 80 chars
* Use of `{...}` is preferred for multi-line chaining blocks
* Use symbol hash keys for all internal structured data
* Use string hash keys for any external structured or unstructured data
* Always use `"` over `'`. Just do it.
